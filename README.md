# TestProject

Testing Repository Setup - This project is for test purposes only.  Initially, it was used to perform testing to learn and document basic Github processes for the future.  

Going forward, it will be used to test process for continued ongoing learning, and to test some files and structures ahead of adding them to future projects.  Example:  Markdown files for future projects may get a draft here that gets migrated to the future project later.  Test folders for projects will follow the convention \<ProjectSecificPrefix_TestFiles\>.
