# TestProject

Testing Repository Setup - This project was created as a test.  Initially, it was used to perform testing to learn and document basic Github processes for the future.  

Going forward, it will be used to: 

  - test processes for continued ongoing learning, 
  - test files and structures ahead of adding them to future projects.  
    - Example:  Markdown files for future projects may get a draft here that gets migrated to the future project later.  
  - Graphics and photos needed for other projects that don't have a home may live here and get referenced in those other projects as well.

Planned conventions:
  - Test folders for projects will follow the convention \<ProjectSecificPrefix_TestFiles\>.
