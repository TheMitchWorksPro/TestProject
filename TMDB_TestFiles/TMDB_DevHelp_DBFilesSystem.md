# TMDB File System Explained

## Overview of the file system
Originally, the idea was to keep a working directory to test code changes, have directories for creating a blank DB and demo dbs to
post to the original website for users to download, and maintain folders for any actual Toastmasters clubs the database was used to track.
For privacy resons, the Toastmaster club folders have been removed from this project.  Folder conventions and folders are explained here.  

This documentation is not comprehensive but should shed some light on what is in this project for those interested in using this code.

## Subfolder Conventions

- Each copy of the database needs the following folders:
  - x
  - x
  - x  

- Thes folders are customized for each DB as follows
  - for a Toastmasters (TM) club, append a short abbreviation or club number at end of each folders
  - Examples:
    - x
	- x
	- x
